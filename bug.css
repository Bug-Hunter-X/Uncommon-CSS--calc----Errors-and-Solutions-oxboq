The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or rendering issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a `width` property of an element inside a container with padding may not produce the expected result if the padding is not explicitly accounted for within the calculation. Another example is the incorrect use of units within the calculation, such as mixing percentages and pixels without proper consideration of the context.
